* SHA1-HASH calculation
* MIME type helpers
* Logger
* Platform restrictions

=== Dependencies

The SDK has the following dependencies:

* link:https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/annotation[AndroidX Annotation] (Android only)

=== Built With

            credentials {
                username = project.findProperty("gpr.user") as String? ?: System.getenv("PACKAGE_REGISTRY_USERNAME")
                password = project.findProperty("gpr.key") as String? ?: System.getenv("PACKAGE_REGISTRY_TOKEN")
            }
        }
    }
}

----

Your GitHub *username* and *token* needs to be stored in your global Gradle properties: `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`

NOTICE:: You need to have _read_ access to this repository and generate a https://github.com/settings/tokens/new/[personal access token] with `repo`, `write:packages` and `read:packages` scope.

----
